        <div id="iconwrapper00"> <p1>Throughout my career, I have worked with various clients and industries, creating designs that effectively communicate their message and engage their target audience. I have helped design shows in the early stages, made album covers, acted as a marketing consultant, curated social media accounts, and led design classes. </br></br>

            As a former student of the School of Nursing at the University of Pennsylvania, who has decided to move away from medicine, it has influenced the type of design I intend to pursue and given me the necessary insight for accessible design. In addition, my two years of study and proficiency in American Sign Language have also provided valuable awareness and understanding of inclusive design.</br></br>
            I believe everyone’s responsibility to ensure that everything is accessible to everyone, and I trust my expertise will inform me. Whether it's designing for people with visual impairments, hearing impairments, or other disabilities, I always strive to create designs that are not only visually appealing but also easy to use and understand. I also have studied different styles and qualifications for accessible architecture and layout. </br></br>
            Sincerely, </br>
            Mikayla Ervin</p1></div>
