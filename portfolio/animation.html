Only recently have Governments made efforts to regulate and restrict the exponentially increasing amount of waste discarded each year.</br></br>    

            To consider (and question) the role and responsibility of designers to effectively communicate messages to the public and their community, I designed a 30-second animated Public Service Announcement poster on Food Waste, using a combination of Adobe After Effects, Photoshop, and Illustrator. </br></br>
            
            I began with researching food waste statistics to help audiences conceptualize the severity and impact of the issues. I then investigated solutions that an everyday person could enact to reduce unnecessary waste.  </br></br>
            
            Afterward, I created storyboards in Adobe Illustrator to map out each frame. Each storyboard was then exported into Adobe Aftereffects to animate and string together. </br></br></br>

            <div id="iconwrapper00"> <p1>3D Animation</br></p1> <p2> </br> For my final project of my Computer Animation course, I wanted to make a glitchy horror video game animation. The clip a first person view of a person being chased down a hall and then in the end corned by a monster. Throughout the video the viewer is expericences scares, such as lighting, blackouts, interactive paintings, moving inanimate objects, slamming doors, and jump scares.</br></br>
            I started by creating a creating a storyboard for the animation of all the frames and events featured in the video. Then, I started modeling using Maya software. I modeled the hallways, room, lighting, furniture, and decor only using spheres, cubes, cylinders and cone shapes, only importing a pre-made plant and lantern. I then created and timed keyframes of the camera and scene to string together to bring the animation to life. The glitch affect is acheived purposefully by taking out certain frames and intentionally keeping corrupted frames. </br></br></br></br></br></br>

                <div id="iconwrapper00"> <p1> Stop Motion Animation</br></p1> <p2> </br> I created this animation as a commentary on the struggles struggles and obstacles of life as a young black man. I compare the black male experience to a peice of gum trying to get of the street and climb up the stoop of a building to safety and metaphorically success. In the begging and end, the gum is stepped on to represent opression, but in the end even though the gum is squashed its still half way to success, facing the staircase inside of the building. The end represents progress and resilience while still having a long way to go.</br></br>
                For this project, I used a stop motion app on my phone to stream together images of the gum inching up the stairs. I made an effort to captures various angles, scales, and depths of fields to keep the video visually stimulating. I recruited the help of my black male friends on campus to act in the video.      </br></br></br></br>
