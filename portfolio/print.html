        <div id="iconwrapper00"> <p1> Riso printing is a unique printing process that creates vibrant, textured prints with a distinct, retro look. The process involves using a special Riso machine that applies ink through a stencil, creating a screen-printed effect. </br></br>

            In this particular case, I started by drawing one thing a day for a semester of school. I added each sketch to one large notability page to act as a visual diary to document things I saw or felt each day. From top to bottom, the progression of my ideas is visible, and the complexity and quality of my drawings build on each other and improve.</br></br> 
            
            Once I felt finished, I printed the visual diary on tabloid printer paper, and then manually cut, manipulated, and added additional design elements to create a cohesive theme for the final artwork and fill the riso print page.</br></br>  
            
            When it was time to print the final artwork, I prepared the design files to be Riso printed. This involves separating the design into individual layers, each of which will be printed separately in a different color using the Riso machine.</br></br>
            
            The Riso machine applies the ink through the stencil onto the paper, creating the unique texture and look of a Riso print. Depending on the design and the colors used, the designer may have had to run the artwork through the Riso machine multiple times, layering different colors on top of each other to achieve the final result.</br></br>
            
            Overall, the process of creating a Riso printed artwork involves a combination of traditional drawing and digital design, as well as an understanding of the unique printing process and how to prepare artwork for it. The end result is a visually striking, one-of-a-kind print that has a distinct aesthetic all its own.</br></br></br>
