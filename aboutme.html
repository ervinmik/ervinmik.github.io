        <div id="iconwrapper02"> <p1>During the first week of third-grade, my class made self-portraits to decorate our homeroom. Before starting mine, I sat in my classroom, staring at the empty red walls, fidgeting with my red tunic buttons, and tracing the frame of the double doors with my eyes. Eventually, I began to mix my skin color. I poured half of the brown bottle onto my palette because that was the one color I was sure about, then mixed in white to match the shade to my exact skin tone. Drop after drop, I added white paint onto my palette, and as I looked around the room at my pale-skinned classmates, I squeezed out even more white paint, making a stale smelling beige mess that was three times lighter than my actual complexion. I even mixed a medium brown for my hair, which was actually near black. Even though my Mom had spent her Sunday washing and styling my hair into braids, I painted myself with straight hair; my rationale was that I had straight hair last week for picture day. Truthfully, I longed for special occasions, such as my birthday and picture day, to get my hair straightened; I associated looking my best with blown-out hair. By the end of the period, I brought a self-portrait to the drying rack that did not resemble myself but, instead, my damaged self-image. </br></br>

            Third grade was not the beginning of my identity issues. I did not see the difference between my chunky braids clipped with barrettes and my classmates’ blonde hair styled with headbands until kindergarten when I was excluded from a group for not having straight blonde hair and blue eyes. This superficial exclusion caused me to resent my own features. I used to like my hair in braids, especially when I put them into a cute ponytail, but all my friends had straight hair, so I assumed their silky texture was superior to my lonely style. To avoid the microaggressions that plagued Black girls at Brearley and assimilate with my white counterparts, I began avoiding the sun to prevent further tanning my skin and started shopping at the same stores as my classmates. I also started straightening my hair every two weeks, which proved to be my most harmful habit; I was destroying my hair. After years of unnecessary heat and mistreatment, my hair began to break off and lose its shape, but I continued to straighten my hair and sweep the damaged pieces off my bathroom floor.</br></br>
            
            During the coronavirus quarantine, I knew I had to stop blowing out my hair and begin to deal with the damage because hair salons were closed.  For the first time in years, I saw my natural curl pattern, and it felt scary but also freeing. I finally realized that straightening my hair for my white peers’ approval had never been in my best interest and was a projection of internalized anti-Blackness because it tried to eliminate my Black features. Therefore, I changed my mindset and style to reinforce a positive self-image and reinvented myself to appeal to no one but me. 
            On the first day of my senior year of highschool, I wore my hair in braids for the first time since third grade, marking the end of my toxic habits and the start of my healthy hair and mind. I cannot go back in time, but I can help prevent younger Black students from experiencing the same 13 years of anti-Blackness. I decided to use my resources and influence to create Seeing in Color, a program to break the cycle of anti-Blackness within younger Black students by helping them explore their identities, introducing them to crucial Black history and figures, and empowering them as a whole. My goal is for their self-portraits from kindergarten to 12th grade to proudly depict who they are and their version of chunky braids and barrettes. </br></br>
            
            Continuing my hair journey into college, I consistently wore my hair in braids. I saw that almost every black woman around me, in my classes and the halls of my dorm, pretty much all wore their hair in braids. We would talk about the next style we wanted to wear or what braiding hair color we wanted to try next, and in those discussions, I saw girls that I could relate to my struggle. It made me think about how even though I tried to empower the young girls at my school so that they could avoid my hair struggle, some older girls need empowerment or support after their traumatic hair journey. My fellow college peers needed a safe place to vent, share, cry, or pat themselves on the back, so when taking my integrative design class that tasked us with creating a prosthetic with commentary or serving a purpose, I immediately knew what product I wanted to design. Using the hooded hair drying from my childhood and a single board computer controller, I engineered a therapeutic safe place for black women to face the harmful objects of hair journey to provide a physical representation of the emotional release. As they spoke into the hot comb that I re-engineered into a microphone, cold air would blow out of the hooded air dryer to serve as a metaphorical and surreal to reverse the trauma of heat-damaged hair and emotional damage of their hair struggles. Designing and engineering my project led me to heal and outgrow my braids and start my natural hair journey. Now, I am proud to say that in the fall semester of 2023, I cut the remaining heat damage out of my hair and for the first time wore my natural hair out for my friends, family, and peers to see. </br></br></p1></div>
